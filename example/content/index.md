## Differentiability

A function of a real variable {{ mathi("f(x)") }} is differentiable at a point {{ mathi("a") }} of its domain, if its domain contains an open interval {{ mathi("I") }} containing {{ mathi("a") }}, and the limit

{{ math("L = \lim_{h \to 0}{\frac{f(a+h) - f(a)}{h}}") }}

exists.
